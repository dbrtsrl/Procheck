ProcApp – Minimal Focus & Procrastination Tracker

ProcApp is a lightweight desktop application (Python + Tkinter) designed for structured work planning, session tracking, and behavioral analysis of procrastination.

It combines three core components:

1. Planner

Plan tasks by day or week

Track planned vs. completed items (based only on fully completed sessions)

Automatic remaining time calculation

2. Session Timer

Target-based focus sessions

Auto-stop with completion confirmation

Early stop tracking (manual interruption before target)

Mark procrastination during a session

Break and cancel options (cancel does not affect performance metrics)

3. Stats & Behavioral Summary

Total completed session time

Completion rate

Early stop rate

Average session length

Average time to first procrastination

ON/OFF visual focus ratio

Task breakdown by selected period
